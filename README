ActiveSeven
===========

A rails implementation for 7th normal form


Usage
=====

Use ActiveSeven::Base rather than ActiveRecord::Base.

  class Monster < ActiveSeven::Base
    has :name,  :string
    has :level, :inetger
  end

ActiveSeven::Base gives "has" class method to define columns.


Creating Tables
===============

ActiveSeven doesn't require migration files for table creation,
because it has already got all information about its schema.
Just send 'migrate' message to your model class on console.

  Monster.migrate

This creates tables for monster class with 7th normal form.
If you want to drop or remigrate it, :down argment helps you.

  Monster.migrate :down
  Monster.migrate


Known Bugs
==========

* "status" feature is broken for loading data
* Support only READ operations of CRUD
